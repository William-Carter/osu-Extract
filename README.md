# osu-Extract
Extract the songs from your osu! libary into proper mp3 form, complete with metadata and album art!

# Usage
Open the run.py in your favourite text editor and point the "songsDirectory" variable at your osu! Songs folder and the "outputDirectory" variable at the folder you want your mp3s to end up.

Once you've done that, run the file and let the program do its job.
